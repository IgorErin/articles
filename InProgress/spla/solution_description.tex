\section{Solution Description}

\subsection{Design Principles}

Multi-GPU

Portability across multiple devices and vendors.

C interface to simplify interaction with other languages. 

Tasks for better load-balancing.

Extensibility: one can easily implement a specific algorithm for primitive operation.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

OpenCL, 

Used libraries (Boost.Compute\footnote{\url{https://github.com/boostorg/compute}.}, taskflow\footnote{Taskflow project home page: \url{https://taskflow.github.io/}. Access date: 07.01.2022.}~\cite{Huang2022TaskflowAL}),  etc
