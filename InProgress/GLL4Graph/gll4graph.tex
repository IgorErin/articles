%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  We show that a fast GLL parsing algorithm provides \textit{context-free path querying} for Neo4j graph database with reasonable performance. The proposed solution solves both the \textit{reachability} and the \textit{all paths} problems for the \textit{all pairs} and the \textit{multiple sources} cases. The evaluation on real-world graphs demonstrates that our solution is more than 25 times faster than the previous solution for Neo4j and is comparable, in some cases,  with the linear algebra based solution for RedisGraph.
