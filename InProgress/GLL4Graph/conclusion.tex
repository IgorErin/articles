\section{Conclusion}

In this work we present a GLL-based context-free path querying algorithm for Neo4j graph database. The implemenattion is available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/GLL4Graph}.

In future, we plan to investigate how to solve the important problems of the single path and the shortest path CFPQ. 
We also plan to adopt the GLL algorithm~\cite{SCOTT2018120} which handles grammars in the Extended Backus-Naur Form~\cite{10.1007/978-3-642-00982-2_35} directly to make graph query languages more user-friendly. 

The most important direction for future work is to find a way to parallelize the GLL-based CFPQ algorithm. The naive data parallel version improves the \textit{Geo} query on \textit{Geospecies} graph by 30\% as compared with the sequential version. Unfortunatelly, is has no effect for the \textit{Go hierarchy} because of the more complex dependencies in the graph. The efficient parallelization of the GLL-based CFPQ algorithm is a challenging problem for future research.
