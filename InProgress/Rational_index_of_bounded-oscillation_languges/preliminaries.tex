\paragraph{Formal languages.} 
A \textit{context-free grammar} is a 4-tuple $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$, where $\Sigma$ is a finite set of alphabet symbols,  $N$ is a set of nonterminal symbols, $P$ is a set of production rules and $S$ is a start nonterinal. $L(G)$ is a context-free language generated by context-free grammar $G$. We use the notation $A \stackrel {*}{\Rightarrow } w$  to denote that the string $w \in \Sigma^*$ can be derived from a nonterminal $A$ by sequence of applying the production rules from $P$. A \textit{parse tree} is an entity which represents the structure of the derivation of a terminal string from some nonterminal.


A grammar $G$ is said to be is in the \textit{Chomsky normal form}, if all production rules of $P$ are of the form:
$A \rightarrow BC$, $A \rightarrow a$ or $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$, where $A, B, C \in N$ and $a \in \Sigma$. 


The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). \textit{Pushdown automaton} is a 7-tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, Z, F)$, where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is a input alphabet, $\Gamma$ is a finite set which is called the stack alphabet, $\delta$ is a finite subset of $Q \times (\Sigma \cap \{\varepsilon\}) \times \Gamma \times Q \times \Gamma^*$,
$q_{0}\in Q$ is the start state, $Z \in \Gamma$ is the initial stack symbol and
$F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states.


A \textit{regular language} is a language that can be expressed with a regular expression or a deterministic or non-deterministic finite automata.
A \textit{nondeterministic finite automaton} (NFA) is represented by a 5-tuple, $(Q,\Sigma ,\delta ,Q_{0},F)$, where $Q$ is a finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is a finite set of input symbols, $\delta:Q\times \Sigma \rightarrow 2^{|Q|}$ is a transition function, $Q_0 \subseteq Q$ is a set of initial states, $F \subseteq Q$ is a set of accepting (final) states. \textit{Deterministic finite automaton} is a NFA with the following restrictions: each of its transitions is uniquely determined by its source state and input symbol, and reading an input symbol is required for each state transition.


 For a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, its rational index $\rho_L$ is a function defined as follows:
$$\rho_L(n) = \max\{\min\{|w|:w \in L \cap K\}, K \in {Rat}_n, L \cap K \neq \emptyset\},$$ where $|w|$ is the length of a word $w$ and ${Rat}_n$ denotes the set of regular languages on an alphabet $\Sigma$, recognized by a finite nondeterministic automation with at most $n$ states.
\paragraph{Bounded-oscillation languages.} 
Oscillation is defined using a hierarchy of \textit{harmonics}. Let $\bar{a}$ be a \textit{push}-move and $a$ be a \textit{pop}-move. Then a PDA run $r$ can be described by a well-nested sequence $\alpha(r)$ of $\bar{a}$-s and $a$-s. Two positions $i<j$ form a \textit{matching pair} if the corresponding $\bar{a}$ at $i$-th position of the sequence matches with $a$ at $j$-th position. For example, word $\bar{a}\bar{a}\bar{a}aa\bar{a}aa$ has the following set of matching pairs: $\{(1, 8), (2, 5), (3, 4), (6, 7)\}$ ($\bar{a}(\bar{a}(\bar{a}a)a)(\bar{a}a)a$).


Harmonics are inductively defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item  order 0 harmonic $h_0$ is $\varepsilon$
\item  $h_{(i+1)}$ harmonic is $\bar{a}h_ia\ \bar{a}h_ia$.
\end{itemize}

PDA run $r$ is \textit{k-oscillating} if the harmonic of order $k$ is the greatest harmonic that occurs in $r$ after removing $0$ or more matching pairs. \textit{Bounded-oscillation languages} are languages accepted by pushdown automata with all runs $k$-oscillating. It is important that the problem whether a given CFL is a bounded-oscillation language is undecidable~\cite{BoundOsc}.
\begin{example}
Consider Figure \ref{oscb}. It shows how the stack height changes during the run of a PDA. Corresponding well-nested word $\alpha(r)$ is $\bar{a}\bar{a}\bar{a}aa\bar{a}aa$. The greatest harmonic in this word is order 1 harmonic (moves forming harmonic are marked in bold, removed matching pairs are $(1, 8)$ and $(2, 5)$): $\bar{a}\bar{a}\mathbf{\bar{a}a}a\mathbf{\bar{a}a}a$, therefore oscillation of the run $r$ is 1.
\end{example}


The oscillation of a parse tree of a context-free grammar can be defined similarly to the oscillation of a PDA run. Given a parse tree $t$, we define corresponding well-nested word $\alpha(t)$ inductively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $n$ is the root of $t$ then $\alpha(t) = \bar{a}\alpha(n)$
\item if $n$ is a leaf then $\alpha(n)=a$
\item if $n$ has $k$ children then $\alpha(n) = a\underbrace{\bar{a}...\bar{a}}_\text{$k$ times}\alpha(n_1)...\alpha(n_k)$
\end{itemize}


Moreover, given a PDA run $r$, there exists a corresponding parse tree $t$ with the same well-nested word $\alpha(t)=\alpha(r)$ and vice versa~\cite{BoundOsc}.


The oscillation of a parse tree is closely related with its $dimension$. For each node $v$ in a tree $t$, its dimension $dim(v)$ is inductively defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $v$ is a leaf, then $dim(v)$ = 0
\item if $v$ is an internal node with $k$ children $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$ for $k \ge 1$, then 
$$
dim(v) = 
 \begin{cases}
   \max_{i \in \{1...k\}}dim(v_i) &\text{if there is a unique maximum}\\
   \max_{i \in \{1...k\}}dim(v_i)+1 &\text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
$$
\end{itemize}


Dimension of a parse tree $t$ $dim(t)$ is a dimension of its root.  It is observable from the definition that dimension of a tree $t$ is the height of the largest perfect binary tree, which can be obtained from $t$ by contracting edges and accordingly identifying vertices. A tree with dimension $dim(t) = 2$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{oscbtree}.

It is known that the dimension of parse trees and its oscillation are in linear relationship.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{BoundOsc}]
\label{boscdim}
Let a grammar $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$ be in Chomsky normal form and let $t$ be a parse tree of $G$. Then $osc(t) - 1 \le dim(t) \le 2osc(t)$.
\end{lemma}
\paragraph{Context-free language reachability.} 
A \textit{directed labeled graph} is a triple $D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta)$, where $Q$ is a finite set of nodes, $\Sigma$ is a finite set of alphabet symbols,
and $\delta \subseteq Q \times \Sigma \times Q$ is a finite set of labeled edges. Let $L(D)$ denote a graph language--- a regular language, which is recognized by the NFA $(Q,\Sigma ,\delta ,Q, Q)$ obtained from $D$ by setting every state as inial and accepting.


Let $i\pi j$ denote a unique path between nodes $i$ and $j$ of the input graph and $l(\pi)$ denote a unique string obtained by concatenating edge labels along the path $\pi$. Then the CFL-reachability can be defined as follows.
\begin{definition}[Context-free language reachability]
Let $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ be a context-free language and $D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta)$ be a directed labeled graph. Given two nodes $i$ and $j$ we say that $j$ is \textit{reachable} from $i$ if there exists a path $i \pi j$, such that $l(\pi) \in L$. 
\end{definition}
There are four varieties of CFL-reachability problems: all-pairs problem, single-source problem, single-target problem and single-source/single-target problem~\cite{RepsBasic}. In this paper we consider all-pairs problem. The \textit{all-pairs problem} is to determine all pairs of nodes $i$ and $j$ such that $j$ is reachable from $i$.
