\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose the first MCFL-reachability algorithm by extending the MCFL parsing algorithm from~\cite{nakanishi1997efficient}. Thus, we show how the MCFL-reachability problem can be solved using the LA operations. We implement the proposed algorithm using the GraphBLAS API. We should improve our prototype implementation using various high-performance libraries for the LA operations, distributed computations, and modern parallel hardware like GPU. Also, we should find the real graphs and queries for more practical use of our algorithm, for example from the area of static code analysis. Further research is also needed to improve the time complexity bound $O(|V|^{e' - 0.624i' + 2m})$ by using the recursive multiplication of submatrices and the sparse matrix operations.
