Recently, there has been an increasing interest in solving problems related to context-free path queries (CFPQ) on graphs.
However, the development of meaningful benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation procedures is lagging, consequently hindering advancements in this area.
To solve this, we introduce the CFPQ\_Data dataset, which contains the most popular graphs for experimental analysis of CFPQ algorithms.
The collection consists of over 40 graphs of varying sizes.
We provide Python-based data loaders and implementations of the well-known CFPQ algorithms.
Here, we give an overview of the CFPQ\_Data dataset, standardized evaluation procedures, and provide baseline experiments.
All datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ_Data}{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ\_Data}.
The experiments are fully reproducible from the code available at \href{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ_PyAlgo}{https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/CFPQ\_PyAlgo}.
