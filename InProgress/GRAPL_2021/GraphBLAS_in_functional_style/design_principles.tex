\section{Design Principles}

In this work we are focused on making development process easier and safer by using !!!. 
Automate optimization.
Accurate type-level encoding of domain: monoids, semirings.

Monoids and semirings are closed under operations. 
Thus, in contrast with GraphBLAS API, all operations in semirings and monoids have the following type: $t \to t \to t$ (instead of $t_1 \to t_2 \to t_3$ as proposed in the GraphBLAS specification).  
It makes our definition less flexible, but allows one to generalize some operations, such as closure of relation.
We realize, that in some cases such restrictive constrains are not required.
Namely, definition of matrix multiplication does not requires a semiring, it just requires two operations $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ with following types: $\otimes: t_1 \to t_2 \to t_3$, $\oplus: t_3 \to t_3 \to t_3 $. 
But formally, a set with such operations is not a semiring.
We think that such case should be investigated separately from semirings, because additional guaranties provided by semirings may be used for code simplification and optimization.
For example, it may help to solve a problem with explicit zeros\footnote{Discussion on zeros removing \url{!!!}. Access date: 12.01.2021. } because we should explicitly specify conversion from one semiring to another if required.  

Matrices and vectors are equipped with monoid or semiring.
Explicit type conversions. 
Can be automatically removed in some cases during translation time.

We propose to generate OpenCL c code in running time as a way to solve problems with generics: with strong typing all type information become known and can be used to generate kernels for specific types.
Moreover, running time code generation is a way to apply advances optimization techniques, such as partial evaluation (or code specialization), which can improve performance of generated code when part of input parameter of kernel becomes known prior its generation~\cite{10.1145/3332466.3374507}.

The example of \texttt{Min-Plus} semiring definition is provided in listing~\ref{lst_example}.
Type is defined using discriminated unions (line 1): new set can contains both floats, marked with  \texttt{R} and a special value \texttt{Infinity}.
Thus floats are extended with infinity as required for accurate definition of \texttt{Min-Plus} semiring.
Semiring definition (lines 3--21) includes definition of zero (idenity), operations $\oplus$ (lines 8--13) and $\otimes$ (lines 14--19), !!!!
