\begin{abstract}
Whereas it has been shown that  the context-free language (CFL) reachability problem is P-complete, there are some subclasses of context-free languages, for which the the CFL-reachability problem lies in NC complexity class. We present two common classes which generalize known examples of such tractable subclasses: bounded-oscillation languages and context-free languages with a poly-slender storage languages. The polynomiality of the rational indices of languages in these classes is proved. Also closure properties of tractable subclasses in terms of the polynomial rational index are investigated.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem for a fixed context-free grammar $G$ is stated as follows: given a directed edge-labeled graph $D$ and a pair of nodes  $u$ and $v$, determine whether there is a path from $u$ to $v$ labeled with a string in $L(G)$.  That is, CFL-reachability is a kind of graph reachability problem with path constraints given by context-free languages. It is an important problem underlying some fundamental static code analysis like data flow analysis and program slicing \cite{RepsBasic}, alias analysis \cite*{Chatterjee, alias}, points-to analysis \cite{Incremental} and other \cite{Cai, android, typeflow}, and graph database query evaluation \cite{Azimov, GrigorevRagozina, HellingsCFPQ, RDF}.


Unlike context-free language recognition, which is in NC (when context-free grammar is fixed), the CFL-reachability problem is P-complete \cite{ RepSeq, Yannakakis}. Practically, it means that there is no efficient parallel algorithm for solving this problem (unless P $\neq$ NC). 


While the problem is not parallelizable in general, it is useful to develop more efficient parallel solutions for specific subclasses of the context-free languages. For example, there are context-free languages which admit more efficient parallel algorithms in comparison with the general case of context-free recognition \cite{IBARRA2, IBARRA, Okhotin2014ComplexityOI}.  The same holds for the CFL-reachability problem: there are some examples of context-free languages, for which the CFL-reachability problem lies in NL complexity class (for example, linear and one-counter languages) \cite{labelledGraphs, LReach, Regularrealizability}. 


The CFL-reachability problem has long been known to be P-complete \cite{PCompl}. The parallel complexity of this problem is studied by both static code analysis \cite{RepSeq, RepsBasic} and database communities \cite{ChainQ, Ullman, Yannakakis}. First investigations of this kind were made in terms of Datalog queries, because some classes of Datalog queries (chain queries) can be represented via context-free grammars with the database considered as a graph. 
\begin{example}[Datalog chain query as a context-free grammar]
Consider a database  $D$ with relation ``$child$''. It can also be represented as a digraph $G$, where each node of the graph corresponds to a person, and edges are labeled with a word ``$child$''.


The following Datalog query determines all pairs of people $x$ and $y$ such that $x$ is a descendant of $y$: 


$Desc(x, y)$ :- $Child(x, y)$

$Desc(x, y)$ :- $Child(x, z), Desc(z, y)$


This query can be represented as a context-free grammar with the following rules: 


$Desc \rightarrow Child$ $\vert$ $Child$ $Desc$


$Child  \rightarrow child$


Thus, evaluating the above mentioned Datalog query over database $D$ is equivalent to the solving the CFL-reachability problem for a context-free grammar representation of this query and the edge-labeled graph $G$.
\end{example}
An important undecidability result was obtained by Gaifman et al. \cite{Vardi}:  it is undecidable for a given context-free grammar $G$ whether the CFL-reachability problem for $G$ is in NC or P-complete. However, Ullman and Van Gelder \cite{Ullman} introduce the notion of a \textit{polynomial fringe property} and show that the CFL-reachability problem for context-free grammars having this property is in NC. A context-free grammar $G$ has the \textit{polynomial fringe property} if and only if there is a polynomial $p$ such that, for each regular language $R$ recognized by an automaton with $n$ states, $L(G) \cap R$ is either empty or contains a word shorter than $p(n)$. It is undecidable whether a context-free grammar has the polynomial fringe property. The results of Ullman and Van Gelder \cite{Ullman} can be reinterpreted in terms of the CFL-reachability as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item CFL-reachability for linear languages is in NC, because the corresponding grammars have the polynomial fringe property
\item The same holds for $D_1$ (the Dyck language on one pair of parentheses) and its images under finite-state transductions (one-counter languages)
\item CFL-reachability for $D_2$ (the Dyck language on two pairs of parentheses) is P-complete.
\end{enumerate}
The third result is important because every context-free language can be represented via a regular language and $D_2$ by Chomsky-Sch{\"u}tzenberger theorem, so it is a direct consequence of P-completeness of CFL-reachability problem in general. Also, using the fact that $D_2$ is included in many interesting subclasses of context-free languages, such as visibly pushdown languages \cite{Okhotin2014ComplexityOI}, simple deterministic languages (defined by LL(1) grammars in Greibach normal form), we can state that the CFL-reachability problem for these languages is P-complete. Afrati et al. \cite{ChainQ} investigate the parallel complexity of Datalog simple chain queries and presents the Polynomial Stack Lemma which will be discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:poly}. 


The polynomial fringe property is equivalent to having polynomial \textit{rational index}: for a context-free language $L(G)$ having the polynomial rational index is the same as for $G$ to have the polynomial fringe property. More precisely, rational index $\rho_L(n)$ is a function, which denotes the maximum length of the shortest word in $L(G) \cap R$, for arbitrary $R$ recognized by an $n$-state automaton. The notion of a rational index was introduced by L. Boasson et al. \cite{RatBasic} as a complexity measure for context-free languages and was investigated independently of the polynomial fringe property.  In particular, it has been proved that the rational index of $D_1$ is in $O( n^2)$ \cite{Dyck1}. 
Another important result concerns the rational index of languages, which generate all context-free languages (an example of such language is $D_2$). It states that the rational index of such languages is of the order $exp(\Theta(n^2/\ln n))$ \cite{CFRat} and, hence, this is the upper bound on the value of the rational index for every context-free language. An example of a non-generating language with exponential rational index is given in \cite{Regularrealizability}. Also it has been shown that for every algebraic number $\gamma $, a language with the rational index in $\Theta (n^\gamma )$ exists \cite{GreibRat}. 


The CFL-reachability problem is the same as the intersection non-emptiness problem for a context-free language (pushdown automaton) and a regular language (finite automaton), because a labeled graph is a special kind of a nondeterministic finite automaton. The complexity of this problem was studied by Ganardi et al. \cite{ ganardi2016circuit},  Swernofsky et al. \cite{Intersection} and Vyalyi \cite{VyalyiRR}.


The computational complexity of the language reachability for different classes of languages (regular, context-free, context-sensitive) and graphs (acyclic graphs, trees, grid graphs) is discussed in detail by Barret et al. \cite{Barrett}, Holzer et al.\cite{labelledGraphs} and Komarath et al. \cite{LReach}.

Our focus is on investigating the parallel complexity of the CFL-reachability problem. Especially we are interested in generalizing of ``easy'' subclasses and discovering new examples of context-free languages, for which the CFL-reachability problem is in NC. Effective subclasses can be useful in practice, because the general problem is not tractable \cite{ExperimentalCFPQ}. For example, in the case of graph databases, it is important to know the complexity of a given context-free path query. Also it is natural to ask, which properties of subclasses imply that the problem is in NC. Why some languages have polynomial rational indices? What is the difference between them and other subclasses of context-free languages?


The hierarchy of subfamilies of context-free languages, for which the CFL-reachability problem is in NC, is presented in Figure~\ref{hierarchy}. Linear languages and one-counter languages are incomparable families of context-free languages, but both have polynomial rational indices (the polynomial fringe property). These subfamilies have one thing in common: both are defined by strong restrictions on the stack in a pushdown automaton. Our main idea is to generalize the known tractable classes by investigating the restrictions on the PDA store.

\textbf{Our contributions.} Our results can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We show that the CFL-reachability problem for bounded-oscillation languages of Ganty and Valput \cite{BoundOsc}, is in NC (see Section \ref{sec:osc}). This class generalizes the case of linear languages. 
\item Closure properties of the languages with the polynomial rational indices are investigated in Section \ref{sec:closure}, particularly it is shown that the family of languages with the polynomial rational index is closed under the insertion of a regular language.
\item In Section \ref{sec:poly} we introduce a new subclass of context-free languages: context-free languages with a poly-slender pushdown store languages. These languages are the natural generalization of one-counter languages, and the CFL-reachability problem for them is in NC. Also we show that deciding poly-slenderness of a pushdown store language is in P.

We have obtained two classes, which extend the classes in the recent literature \cite{ChainQ, labelledGraphs, LReach, Regularrealizability, Ullman}, for which the CFL-reachability problem is in NC. One of them is the class of bounded-oscillation languages, which generalizes the linear languages. The second class is context-free languages with a poly-slender pushdown store languages, which is the generalization of the one-counter languages. Recall that regular languages have the polynomial fringe property (and are accepted by a PDA with a bounded stack height), also it is known that L-reachability for regular languages is in NL \cite{LReach, Yannakakis}. Thereby it has been demonstrated that some natural restrictions on the pushdown storage implies the polynomial rational index for the corresponding context-free languages: the low variability of stack height during the PDA run (bounded-oscillation PDA) and the limited number of possible stack contents (languages with poly-slender pushdown store languages). The updated hierarchy of tractable subclasses and corresponding upper bounds on the rational indices are illustrated in Figure~\ref{hierarchyfinal}.


It will be interesting to know whether there is any other stack restriction which implies polynomial rational index. Are there any other properties (except polynomial rational index) which make the CFL-reachability problem solvable in NC? For example, there is a Datalog query, which does not have the polynomial fringe property but its evaluation is in NC \cite{Kanellakis}. One can also approach this question from another direction by looking for simple subfamilies of context-free languages that would have P-complete CFL-reachability problem.


Also it is interesting to consider other machine models with stores having store restrictions examined in this work. Do these restrictions imply that certain properties could become decidable or their complexity could be reduced? Store languages of different machine models and their applications are studied in \cite{ Ibarra2018OnSL, IBARRA201928}.


We considered the CFL-reachability problem for a fixed context-free languages and arbitrary graphs. What tractable cases can be obtained for a fixed graphs and an arbitrary context-free language? The known and trivial examples are acyclic graphs and trees. Can we have more complicated classes of graphs for which the CFL-reachability problem is in NC? Interesting algebraic properties of such graphs (NFA) are given in \cite{ganardi2016circuit}, but automata-theoretic characterizations of these properties remain to be found.
