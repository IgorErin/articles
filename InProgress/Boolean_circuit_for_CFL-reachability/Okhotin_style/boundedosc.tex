\section{Bounded-oscillation languages}
\label{sec:osc}
Bounded-oscillation languages were introduced by Ganty and Valput \cite{BoundOsc}. Just like one-counter and linear languages, it is defined by restriction on the pushdown automata. This restriction is based on the notion of \textit{oscillation}, a special measure of how the stack height varies over time. 


Oscillation is defined using a hierarchy of \textit{harmonics}. Let $\bar{a}$ be a \textit{push}-move and $a$ be a \textit{pop}-move. Then a PDA run $r$ can be described by a well-nested sequence $\alpha(r)$ of $\bar{a}$-s and $a$-s. Two positions $i<j$ form a \textit{matching pair} if the corresponding $\bar{a}$ at $i$-th position of the sequence matches with $a$ at $j$-th position. For example, word $\bar{a}\bar{a}\bar{a}aa\bar{a}aa$ has the following set of matching pairs: $\{(1, 8), (2, 5), (3, 4), (6, 7)\}$ ($\bar{a}(\bar{a}(\bar{a}a)a)(\bar{a}a)a$).


Harmonics are inductively defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item  order 0 harmonic $h_0$ is $\varepsilon$
\item  $h_{(i+1)}$ harmonic is $\bar{a}h_ia\ \bar{a}h_ia$.
\end{itemize}

PDA run $r$ is \textit{k-oscillating} if the harmonic of order $k$ is the greatest harmonic that is contained in $r$ after removing $0$ or more matching pairs. \textit{Bounded-oscillation languages} are languages accepted by pushdown automata restricted to $k$-oscillating runs. It is important that the problem whether a given CFL is a bounded-oscillation language is undecidable \cite{BoundOsc}.
\begin{example}
Consider Figure \ref{oscb}. It shows how the stack height changes during the run of a PDA. Corresponding well-nested word $\alpha(r)$ is $\bar{a}\bar{a}\bar{a}aa\bar{a}aa$. The greatest harmonic in this word is order 1 harmonic (moves forming harmonic are marked in bold, removed matching pairs are $(1, 8)$ and $(2, 5)$): $\bar{a}\bar{a}\mathbf{\bar{a}a}a\mathbf{\bar{a}a}a$, therefore oscillation of the run $r$ is 1.
\end{example}


The oscillation of a parse tree of a context-free grammar can be defined similiarly to the oscillation of a PDA run. Given a parse tree $t$, we define corresponding well-nested word $\alpha(t)$ inductively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $n$ is the root of $t$ then $\alpha(t) = \bar{a}\alpha(n)$
\item if $n$ is a leaf then $\alpha(n)=a$
\item if $n$ has $k$ children then $\alpha(n) = a\underbrace{\bar{a}...\bar{a}}_\text{$k$ times}\alpha(n_1)...\alpha(n_k)$
\end{itemize}


Moreover, given a PDA run $r$, there exists a corresponding parse tree $t$ with the same well-nested word $\alpha(t)=\alpha(r)$ and vice versa \cite{BoundOsc}.


The oscillation of a parse tree is closely related with its $dimension$. For each node $v$ in a tree $t$, its dimension $dim(v)$ is inductively defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $v$ is a leaf, then $dim(v)$ = 0
\item if $v$ is an internal node with $k$ children $v_1, v_2, ..., v_k$ for $k \ge 1$, then 
$$
dim(v) = 
 \begin{cases}
   \max_{i \in \{1...k\}}dim(v_i) &\text{if there is a unique maximum}\\
   \max_{i \in \{1...k\}}dim(v_i)+1 &\text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
$$
\end{itemize}


Dimension of a parse tree $t$ $dim(t)$ is a dimension of its root.  It is observable from the definition that dimension of a tree $t$ is the height of the largest perfect binary tree, which can be obtained from $t$ by contracting edges and accordingly identifying vertices. A tree with dimension $dim(t) = 2$ is illustrated in Figure \ref{oscbtree}.


It is known that the dimension of parse trees and its oscillation are in linear relationship.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{BoundOsc}]
\label{boscdim}
Let a grammar $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$ be in Chomsky normal form and let $t$ be a parse tree of $G$. Then $osc(t) - 1 \le dim(t) \le 2osc(t)$.
\end{lemma}

Before we consider the value of the rational index for $k$-bounded-oscillation languages, we need to prove the following.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:treeheight}
Let  $G = (\Sigma, N, P)$ be a context-free grammar,  $D=(V, E, \Sigma)$ be a directed labeled graph with $n$ nodes. Let $w$ be the shortest string in $L(G)\cap L(D)$. Then the height of every parse tree for $w$ does not exceed $|N|n^2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider a parse tree for $w$ which is constructed in the following way: every node of the parse tree is marked with realizable triple (see Definition~\ref{def:triple}); for every rule $A \rightarrow A_1A_2...A_k \in P$ a node labeled with $(A, i, j)$ has children marked with $(A_1, i, v_1), (A_2, v_1, v_2), ..., (A_k, v_k, j)$, and every leaf is marked with a triple $(a, i, j)$, where $(i, j)$ is an edge of the input graph labeled with a symbol $a$. Assume that such parse tree for $w$ has a height of more than $|N|n^2$. Consider a path from the root of the parse tree to a leaf, which has the length of more than $|N|n^2$. There are $|N|n^2$ unique labels $(A, i, j)$ for nodes of the parse tree, so according to the pigeonhole principle, this path has at least two nodes with the same label. This means that the parse tree for $w$ contains at least one subtree $t$ with label $(A, i, j)$ at the root, which has a subtree $t'$ with the same label. Then we can change $t$ with $t'$ and get a new string $w'$ which is shorter than $w$. But $w$ is the shortest, then we have a contradiction.

\end{proof}
From Lemma \ref{lem:treeheight} we have that rational index of linear languages is in $O(n^2)$. 
\begin{lemma}
\label{oscbnddim}
Let $G$ be a grammar $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$ in Chomsky normal form, such that every parse tree $t$ has $dim(t) \le d$, where $d$ is some constant. Let $D=(V, E, \Sigma)$ be a directed labeled graph with $n$ nodes. Then $\rho_{L(G)}$ is in $O({(|N|n^2)}^d)$ in the worst case.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Proof by induction on dimension $dim(t)$.
\\
\textbf{Basis.} $dim(t) = 1$.
\\
Consider a tree $t$ with the dimension $dim(t) = 1$. The root of the tree has the same dimension and has two children (because the grammar is in Chomsky normal form). There are two cases:  first, when both of child nodes have dimension equal to 0, then the tree has only two leaves, and second, when one of the children has dimension 1, and the second child has dimension 0. For the second case we can recursively construct a tree with the maximum number of leaves in the following way. Every internal node of such a tree has two children, one of which has dimension equal to 0 and therefore has only one leaf. By Lemma \ref{lem:treeheight}, the maximum height $h$ of such tree is at most $|N|n^2$, so the number of leaves in it is $O(h) = O(|N|n^2)$.
\\
\textbf{Inductive step.} $dim(t) = d + 1$.
\\
Assume that $\rho_{L(G)}$ is at most $O(h^{d})$ for every $d$ in the worst case, where $h$ is the height of the tree. We have two cases for the root node with dimension equal to $d+1$: 1) both of children have a dimension equal to $d$, then by proposition the tree of heght $h$ has no more than $O(h^{d})$ leaves; 2) one of the children has a dimension $d + 1$, and the second child $v$ has a dimension $dim(v) \le d$. Again, a tree with the maximum number of leaves can be constructed recursively:  each node of such tree has two children $u$ and $v$ with dimensions $d+1$ and $d$ respectively (the greater the dimension of the node, the more leaves are in the corresponding tree in the worst case). By the induction assumption there are no more than $(h-1)^d + (h-2)^d + (h-3)^d + ... + 1 = O(h^{d+1})$ leaves, so the claim holds for $dim = d+1$. Finally, $\rho_{L(G)}$ is almost $O(h^{d}) = O({(|N|n^2)}^d)$ for every $d$, because $h \le |N|n^2$ by Lemma \ref{lem:treeheight}. 
\end{proof}
Combining Lemma \ref{boscdim} and Lemma \ref{oscbnddim}, we can deduce the following.
\begin{theorem}
\label{oscbndosc}
Let $L$ be a $k$-bounded-oscillation language with grammar $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$ in Chomsky normal form and $D=(V, E, \Sigma)$ be a directed labeled graph with $n$ nodes. Then $\rho_{L(G)}$ is in $O({|N|}^{2k}n^{4k})$ in the worst case.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{boscdim}, every parse tree of bounded-oscillation language has also bounded dimension. Then the maximum value of the dimension of every parse tree of $k$-bounded-oscillation language is $2k$. By Lemma~\ref{oscbnddim}, $\rho_{L(G)}$ is in $O({(|N|n^2)}^d)$ and, thus, $\rho_{L(G)}$ does not exceed $O({(|N|n^2)}^{2k}) = O({|N|}^{2k}n^{4k})$.
\end{proof}

As we can see from the proof of Lemma~\ref{oscbnddim}, the family of linear languages is included in the family of bounded-oscillation languages. The reason is that the family of bounded-oscillation languages generalizes the family of languages accepted by finite-turn pushdown automata \cite{BoundOsc}. It is interesting that for general PDA, particularly for $D_2$, the value of osciillation is not constant-bounded: it depends on the length of input and does not exeed $O(\log n)$ for the input of length $n$ \cite*{Gundermann, Wechsung}. However, for some previously studied subclasses of context-free languages,  oscillation is bounded by a constant.

\begin{example}[Superlinear languages \cite{superlinear}] A context-free grammar $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$ is \textit{superlinear} if all productions of $P$ satisfy these conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item there is a subset $N_L \subseteq N$ such that every $A \in N_L$ has only linear productions $A\rightarrow aB$ or $A\rightarrow Ba$, where $B \in N_L$ and $a \in \Sigma$.
\item if $A \in N \setminus N_L$, then $A$ can have non-linear productions of the form $A \rightarrow BC$ where $B\in N_L$ and $C \in N$, or linear productions of the form $A\rightarrow \alpha B$ $\vert$ $B \alpha$ $\vert$ $\alpha$ for $B \in N_L$, $\alpha \in \Sigma^*$.
\end{enumerate}
From the grammar $G$ it is observable that its parse trees have dimension at most 2. From 
Lemma~\ref{oscbnddim}, if dimensions of all parse trees are bounded by some $k$ then the rational index of such language is polynomial, so the CFL-reachability problem for superlinear languages is in NC. 
\end{example}
