\section{Future Work}

In the future, first of all, we should close a technical debt and make the distiller more stable to handle all important cases: current implementation can not handle such important functions as matrix-matrix multiplication.
Along with it, we should improve the input language to make it more user-friendly.
The main challenge here is to find the balance between language expressivity and the practicality of distillation for it.

When the language and the distiller will be stable enough, we plan to implement a full-featured generic linear algebra library power enough to express basic graph analysis algorithms and to create and train neural networks.
After that, a number of graph analysis algorithms and neural networks will be implemented and evaluated.

Along with it we plan to improve both FHW and Reduceron and compilers for it in order to make them mature enough to handle real-world examples.
For example, it is necessary to support out-of-chip memory.
