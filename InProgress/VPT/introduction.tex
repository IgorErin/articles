\section{Introduction}

Nowadays high-performance processing of a huge amount of data is an actual challenge not only for scientific computing but for applied systems.
Special types of hardware, such as General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), FPGA-based solutions, along with respective specialized software were developed to provide appropriate solutions, and the development of new solutions continues. And one of problems both software and hardware is a memory traffic

Itermediate data. The simple well-known example is a pipelined processing of collections: \verb| map g (map f data)|. Suppose \verb|data| is a list, then the first map produces a new list which then will be traversed by the second map. The same pattern can be observed in newrlan networks where initial data flows throu network layers, or in linear algebra expressions where each subexpression produces intermediate matrix. The last case occurce not only in scintific cimputations, but in graph analysis~\cite{graphblast}. It is important that not only data structure will be traversed twice while can be traversed only once, but the intermediate data will also be stored (to RAM) which is a big problem for real-world data analysis: the size of data is huge and memory access is one of the expensive operations.
A number of complex real-world cases can be successfully optimized: stream fusion~\cite{} using, danse layers fusion~\cite{} can be successfully optimized by deforestaion~\cite{!!!}. Stream fusion libraryes~\cite{!!!} But general technoqies for such important case as sparse data processing still not found, while some !!!! Sparse kernels fusion....


It was shown that linear algebra is a common language which brings together such areas as 
ML~\cite{fusion-boosting-memory-computations}, NN~\cite{Kepner2017}, graph analysis, bio data~\cite{DBLP:conf/sc/SelvitopiEGPAB20} graphblas(t)~\cite{graphblast}.  Machine learning, Social network analysis


Deforestation, stream fusion (fold/unfold transformations), supercompilation. Distillation!
