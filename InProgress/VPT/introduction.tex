\section{Introduction}

Nowadays high-performance processing of a huge amount of data is an actual challenge not only for scientific computing but for applied systems.
Special types of hardware, such as General Purpose Graphic Processing Units (GPGPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), FPGA-based solutions, along with respective specialized software were developed to provide appropriate solutions, and the development of new solutions continues.

. The simple well-known example is a pipelined processing of collections: \verb| map g (map f data)|. Suppose \verb|data| is a list, then the first map produces a new list which then will be traversed by the second map. It is important that not only list will be traversed twice while can be traversed only once, but the intermediate list will also be stored (to RAM) which is a big problem for real-world data analysis: the size of data is huge and memory access is one of the expensive operations.
This case, and even more complex real-world cases, can be successfully optimized by deforestaion~\cite{!!!}. Stream fusion libraryes~\cite{!!!}

Deforestation, stream fusion (fold/unfold transformations). kernels fusion XLA~\cite{XLA}, MLIR, sparse kernels fusion.  But problem still not solved. 

Linear algebra is a common language which brings together such areas as 
ML~\cite{fusion-boosting-memory-computations}, graph analysis, graphblas(t)~\cite{graphblast}.  Machine learning, Social network analysis

Specialized hardware for functional languages.
