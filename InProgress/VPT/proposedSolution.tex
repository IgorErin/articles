\section{Proposed Solution}

We propose to  ANYDSL~\cite{!!!} Futhark~\cite{!!!}
We propose to use distillation~\cite{!!!} as an optimization method Tail-modulo-cons  Multiply-add

General-purpose functional-language-friendly hardware: Reduceron~\cite{!!!} Specialization for Reduceron~\cite{!!!}

program-specific hardware FHW~\cite{!!!} FPGA. Kiwi

High-level view of architecture is provided in figure~\ref{!!!}
