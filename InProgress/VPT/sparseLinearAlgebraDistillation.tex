\begin{abstract}
    %% Linear algebra is a common language for many areas including machine learning and graph analysis. 
    %% It is a way to provide high-performance solutions by utilizing the highly parallelizable nature of linear algebra operations.
    %% However, intermediate data structures that arise during linear algebra expressions evaluation are one of the performance bottlenecks, especially for sparse data.
    %% We show that distillation appears to be a promising way to optimize linear algebra-based programs, and deals with such intermediate structures. 
  Linear algebra is a common language for many areas, including machine learning and graph analysis, providing high-performance solutions utilizing the highly parallelizable nature of linear algebra operations.
  However, a variety of intermediate data structures arising during linear algebra expressions evaluation is one of the primary performance bottlenecks, especially when sparse data are used.
  We show that program distillation can be efficiently used to optimize linear algebra-based programs, minimizing appearance and evaluation over intermediate data structures at runtime.
