abstract="Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.",

abstract="We investigate regular realizability (RR) problems, which are the problems of verifying whether the intersection of a regular languageÂ -- the input of the problem -- and a fixed language, called a filter, is non-empty. In this paper we focus on the case of context-free filters. The algorithmic complexity of the RR problem is a very coarse measure of the complexity of context-free languages. This characteristic respects the rational dominance relation. We show that a RR problem for a maximal filter under the rational dominance relation is {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbf {\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}-complete. On the other hand, we present an example of a {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbf {\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}-complete RR problem for a non-maximal filter. We show that RR problems for Greibach languages belong to the class {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbf {\{}NL{\}}{\$}{\$}. We also discuss RR problems with context-free filters that might have intermediate complexity. Possible candidates are the languages with polynomially-bounded rational indices. We show that RR problems for these filters lie in the class {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbf {\{}NSPACE{\}}({\backslash}log ^2 n){\$}{\$}.",

abstract="This paper is a survey of the many applications of the theory of parallel algorithms and complexity to logic programming problems. The mathematical tools relevant to the analysis of parallel logic programs include: the concept of alternation, the complexity class NC, and parallel algorithms using randomization and/or achieving optimal speed-ups. The logic programming problems addressed are related to query optimization for deductive databases and to fast parallel execution of primitive operations in logic programming languages, such as, fixpoint operators, term unification, and term matching. The formal language we use to illustrate the addition of recursion to database queries is the language of logical query programs (or programs), whose evaluation has been the object of much recent research. Our presentation highlights the fact that all of these results can be stated using the stage function sH(n) of a program H, where n is the size of the database queried. In this context we also present two new observations. (1) Given a linear single rule program H, it is NP-hard to decide whether sH(n)=O(1); this extends the bounded recursion analysis of[57, 42]. (2) There is a program that can be evaluated in s(n)=O(log n) stages, but whose derivation trees (of width 1) are of size exponential in n. An extension of derivation trees from width 1 to constant width properly strengthens the fast evaluation method of [76].",

A recognizer (transducer) is of polynomial ambiguity (valued) if there exists a polynomial P such that the number of derivations (outputs) for any input of length n is at most P(n). We relate these problems and show that they are decidable for finite-state devices. For cfl's, only the sparseness problem is decidable. We also study some properties of structure generating function defined as fL(z)=$\Sigma$anzn, where anis the number of strings of length n in a language L.

New algorithms and characterizations of store languages are obtained, such as the result that any nondeterministic pushdown automaton augmented with reversal-bounded counters, where the pushdown can âflipâ its contents a bounded number of times, can be accepted by a machine with only reversal-bounded counters. Connections are made between store languages and several model checking and reachability problems, such as accepting the set of all predecessor and successor configurations of a machine from a given (regular) set of configurations. For a variety of different machine models often containing multiple parallel data stores, these sets can be accepted with a machine model that is simpler than the original model itself. Store languages are key to showing these properties."

Our main result is that every turn-bounded grammar is equivalent to a turn-bounded grammar in Greibach form, a property not shared by the ultralinear grammars. Since Greibach's construction does not preserve turnboundedness an alternate construction is required to obtain our result. As a corollary we have that every È¨-free ultralinear language is accepted by a onestate finite-turn pda that reads an input symbol on every move."

In particular, we investigate linearisability of (database queries corresponding to) piecewise linear Datalog programs and chain queries: (a) We prove that piecewise linear Datalog programs can always be transformed into linear Datalog programs, by virtue of a procedure which performs the transformation automatically. The procedure relies upon conventional logic program transformation techniques. (b) We identify a new class of linearisable chain queries, referred to as pseudo-regular, and prove their linearisability constructively, by generating, for any given pseudo-regular chain query, the Datalog program corresponding to it."

equality (=) and inequality (â ) is prohibited. We show that H+ is more expressive
than YE++ and that any H+ program can be transformed into an equivalent H+ program
containing a single recursive predicate without using the equality or inequality operators.
As a corollary we obtain a fixpoint formula characterization of H+ queries.We consider
the problems of determining containment, equivalence, and satisfiability of logic
based queries. The containment and equivalence problems addressed here extend the
work of Aho, Sagiv and Ullman on relational queries [1] and Papadimitrious on Prolog
[10]. As corollaries we show that determining safety and literal redundancy are both
undecidable problems.},
