\section{Problem statement}\label{ps}
The aim of the work is to improve the implementation of the GLL-based CFPQ algorithm and to measure the performance of provided implementation on real-world graphs. In order to achieve the aim, the following objectives have been set.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To analyze and refactor the code of the current implementation of the GLL-based CFPQ algorithm for identifying and eliminating performance problems.
   \item To provide an ability to solve both, the \texttt{reachability CFPQ problem} and \texttt{all paths CFPQ problem}.
   \item To evaluate the resulting algorithm on real-world graphs and to compare it with the existing one.
\end{itemize}
