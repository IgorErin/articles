\section*{Conclusion}\label{sec:current_results}

The following results have been obtained.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The performance problems in the implementation of the GLL-based CFPQ algorithm were eliminated.
    \item The implementation of GLL-based CFPQ algorithm was extended with ability to solve both, \texttt{the reachability} and \texttt{the all paths CFPQ problem}.
    \item The resulting algorithm implementation was evaluated on two sets of real-world graphs: a number of graphs related to RDF analysis and a number of graph related to static code analysis problem for both the \texttt{all pairs} and the \texttt{multiple sources} scenarios. The evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm is more than 45 times faster than the previous solution for Neo4j.
\end{itemize}
