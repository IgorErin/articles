\section*{Problem statement}
The aim of this work is to evaluate whether it is practical and effective to utilize distillation and specialized hardware to optimize programs that contain sparse linear algebra routines. The work elaborates on distillation and high-level synthesis, outlining key challenges to obtain a better solution. In order to achieve the aim, the following objectives were set.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Study approaches for providing fusion in different areas.
    \item Implement hardware generation with fusion in mind.
    \item Design memory interface.
    \item Implement the testbench and carry out the evaluation.
\end{itemize}
