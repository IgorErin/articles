    abstract = {The extension of SPARQL in version 1.1 with property paths offers a type of regular path query for RDF graph databases. Such queries are difficult to optimize and evaluate efficiently, however. We have embarked on a project, Waveguide, to build a cost-based optimizer for SPARQL queries with property paths. Waveguide builds a query plan--- which we call a waveplan (WP)--- which guides the query evaluation. There are numerous choices in the construction of a plan, and a number of optimization methods, so the space of plans for a query can be quite large. Execution costs of plans for the same query can vary by orders of magnitude. A WGP's costs can be estimated, which opens the way to cost-based optimization. We demonstrate that the plan space of Waveguide properly subsumes existing techniques and that the new plans it adds are relevant.},

As confirmed by an extensive experimental evaluation, our system scales linearly with the number of vertices and/or edges, and it can efficiently query graphs up to a billion vertices and 100 billion edges.},

    abstract = {Context-free path querying is a technique, which recently gains popularity in many areas, for example, graph databases, bioinformatics, static analysis, etc. In some of these areas, it is often required to query large graphs, and existing algorithms demonstrate a poor performance in this case. The generalization of matrix-based Valiant's context-free language recognition algorithm for graph case is widely considered as a recipe for efficient context-free path querying; however, no progress has been made in this direction so far.We propose the first generalization of matrix-based Valiant's algorithm for context-free path querying. Our generalization does not deliver a truly sub-cubic worst-case complexity algorithm, whose existence still remains a hard open problem in the area. On the other hand, the utilization of matrix operations (such as matrix multiplication) in the process of context-free path query evaluation makes it possible to efficiently apply a wide class of optimizations and computing techniques, such as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), parallel processing, sparse matrix representation, distributed-memory computation, etc. Indeed, the evaluation on a set of conventional benchmarks shows, that our algorithm outperforms the existing ones.},

    abstract = {With the proliferation of knowledge graphs, massive RDF graphs have been published on the Web. As an essential type of queries for RDF graphs, Regular Path Queries (RPQs) have been attracting increasing research efforts. However, the existing query processing approaches mainly focus on RPQs under the standard semantics, which cannot provide the provenance of the answer sets. We propose a distributed Pregel-based approach DP2RPQ to evaluating provenance-aware RPQs over big RDF graphs. Our method employs Glushkov automata to keep track of matching processes of RPQs in parallel. Meanwhile, three optimization strategies are devised according to the cost model, including vertex-computation optimization, message-communication reduction, and counting-paths alleviation, which can reduce the intermediate results of the basic DP2RPQ algorithm dramatically and overcome the counting-paths problem to some extent. The proposed algorithms are verified by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which show that our approach can efficiently answer the provenance-aware RPQs over large RDF graphs. Furthermore, the RPQ semantics of DP2RPQ is richer than that of RDFPath, and the performance of DP2RPQ is still far better than that of RDFPath.},
