\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we propose a new modification of Azimov's matrix-based CFPQ algorithm for all-path query semantics. We implement our algorithm using GraphBLAS API and provide a comparison of the most performant linear algebra-based algorithms for different query semantics. %We show that the proposed algorithm is performant enough for real-world data analysis and is comparable with other most performant CFPQ implementations.

We compare the CPU-based implementation. In the future, we want to obtain GPU-based and distributed implementations that also uses the GraphBLAS API.

Also, further improvements in index creation and path extraction for both matrix-based and Kronecker product-based algorithms are required. These algorithms solve the CFPQ problem for all vertex pairs but in many real-world scenarios it is redundant to handle all possible pairs, instead one can provide one or a relatively small set of start vertices. Thus we plan to provide the multiple-source modifications for all linear algebra-based CFPQ algorithms as it was done for the matrix-based algorithm w.r.t. the relational query semantics~\cite{mscfpq}.
