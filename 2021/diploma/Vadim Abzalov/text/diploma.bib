abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},

abstract = {As more RDF data management systems and RDF data querying techniques emerge, RDF benchmarks providing a controllable and comparable testing environment for applications are needed. To address the needs of diverse applications, we propose an application-specific framework, called RBench, to generate RDF benchmarks. RBench takes an RDF dataset from any application as a template, and generates a set of synthetic datasets with similar characteristics including graph structure and literal labels, for the required "size scaling factor" and the "degree scaling factor". RBench analyzes several features from the given RDF dataset, and uses them to reconstruct the new benchmark graph. A flexible query load generation process is then proposed according to the design of RBench. Efficiency and usability of RBench are demonstrated via experimental results.},

abstract = {Context-free path queries extend regular path queries for increased expressiveness. A context-free grammar is used to recognize accepted paths by their label strings, or traces. Such queries arise naturally in graph analytics, e.g., in bioinformatics applications. Currently, the practical performance of methods for context-free path query evaluation is not well understood. In this work, we study three state of the art context-free path query evaluation methods. We measure the performance of these methods on diverse query workloads on various data sets and compare their results. We showcase how these evaluation methods scale as graphs get bigger and queries become larger or more ambiguous. We conclude that state of the art solutions are not able to cope with large graphs as found in practice.},

abstract = {This paper presents a demand-driven, flow-insensitive analysisalgorithm for answering may-alias queries. We formulate thecomputation of alias queries as a CFL-reachability problem, and use this formulation to derive a demand-driven analysis algorithm. The analysis uses a worklist algorithm that gradually explores the program structure and stops as soon as enough evidence is gathered to answer the query. Unlike existing techniques, our approach does not require building or intersecting points-to sets.Experiments show that our technique is effective at answering alias queries accurately and efficiently in a demand-driven fashion. For a set of alias queries from the SPEC2000 benchmarks, an implementation of our analysis is able to accurately answer 96% of the queries in 0.5 milliseconds per query on average, using only 65 KB of memory. Compared to a demand-driven points-to analysis that constructs and intersects points-to sets on the fly, our alias analysis can achieve better accuracy while running more than 30 times faster. The low run-time cost and low memory demands of the analysis make it a very good candidate not only for compilers, but also for interactive tools, such as program understanding tools or integrated development environments (IDEs).},

abstract = {Many program-analysis based tools require precise points-to/alias information only for some program variables. To meet this requirement efficiently, there have been many works on demand-driven analyses that perform only the work necessary to compute the points-to or alias information on the requested variables (queries). However, these demand-driven analyses can be very expensive when applied on large systems where the number of queries can be significant. Such a blow-up in analysis time is unacceptable in cases where scalability with real-time constraints is crucial; for example, when program analysis tools are plugged into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In this paper, we propose schemes to improve the scalability of demand-driven analyses without compromising on precision.Our work is based on novel ideas for eliminating irrelevant and redundant data-flow paths for the given queries. We introduce the idea of batch analysis, which can answer multiple given queries in batch mode. Batch analysis suits the environments with strict time constraints, where the queries come in batch. We present a batch alias analysis framework that can be used to speed up given demand-driven alias analysis. To show the effectiveness of this framework, we use two demand-driven alias analyses (1) the existing best performing demand-driven alias analysis tool for race-detection clients and (2) an optimized version thereof that avoids irrelevant computation. Our evaluations on a simulated data-race client, and on a recent program-understanding tool, show that batch analysis leads to significant performance gains, along with minor gains in precision.},
