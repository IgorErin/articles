abstract = {Context-free path querying is a technique, which recently gains popularity in many areas, for example, graph databases, bioinformatics, static analysis, etc. In some of these areas, it is often required to query large graphs, and existing algorithms demonstrate a poor performance in this case. The generalization of matrix-based Valiant's context-free language recognition algorithm for graph case is widely considered as a recipe for efficient context-free path querying; however, no progress has been made in this direction so far.We propose the first generalization of matrix-based Valiant's algorithm for context-free path querying. Our generalization does not deliver a truly sub-cubic worst-case complexity algorithm, whose existence still remains a hard open problem in the area. On the other hand, the utilization of matrix operations (such as matrix multiplication) in the process of context-free path query evaluation makes it possible to efficiently apply a wide class of optimizations and computing techniques, such as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units), parallel processing, sparse matrix representation, distributed-memory computation, etc. Indeed, the evaluation on a set of conventional benchmarks shows, that our algorithm outperforms the existing ones.},

abstract = {Recently proposed matrix multiplication based algorithm for context-free path querying (CFPQ) offloads the most performance-critical parts onto boolean matrices multiplication. Thus, it is possible to achieve high performance of CFPQ by means of modern parallel hardware and software. In this paper, we provide results of empirical performance comparison of different implementations of this algorithm on both real-world data and synthetic data for the worst cases.},

abstract = {Context-free path queries extend regular path queries for increased expressiveness. A context-free grammar is used to recognize accepted paths by their label strings, or traces. Such queries arise naturally in graph analytics, e.g., in bioinformatics applications. Currently, the practical performance of methods for context-free path query evaluation is not well understood. In this work, we study three state of the art context-free path query evaluation methods. We measure the performance of these methods on diverse query workloads on various data sets and compare their results. We showcase how these evaluation methods scale as graphs get bigger and queries become larger or more ambiguous. We conclude that state of the art solutions are not able to cope with large graphs as found in practice.},
