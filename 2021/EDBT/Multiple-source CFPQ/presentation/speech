1) Hi! My name is Semyon and I show you that partial evaluation can optimize GPU procedures.

2) Huge data analysis and limited memory size lead to data chunking and as a result, we have many runs of the single procedure. But filter parameters are fixed during all these runs. 
So, the question is can we utilize this fact to optimize our procedure?

3) Yes, we can do it by using partial evaluation.
The partial evaluator or mix is a procedure which can generates a new optimized procedure for the given procedure and its fixed parameters as shown in this slide.

4) We evaluate this approach by using AnyDSL framework.
Two algorithms are implemented and evaluated on two different GPUs

5) The first case is the substring matching. Here we can see that the partially evaluated version is significantly faster than manually created versions with different locations of patterns.

6) The next case is an image convolution. Here we can see that the effect of specialization depends on GPU architecture and this case should be analyzed in the future.

7) Also, in the future, we plan improve aur approach and to evaluate it on real-world cases.

8) That's all. Thank you for attention.
